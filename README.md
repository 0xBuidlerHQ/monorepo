> The @0xBuidlerHQ monorepo is the single home for every library, package, and product we ship. Everything lives in the open, so you can read, fork, and contribute without friction.

## Libraries

> Open-source building blocks that accelerate day-to-day engineering: from animation helpers to opinionated WAGMI integrations that feel consistent across platforms.

- [bettermotion](libraries/animotion/lib/)
- [wagmui](libraries/wagmui/lib/)

## Projects

> Full-stack builds and experimental apps created within @0xBuidlerHQ. Expect multi-app setups, shared packages, and production-grade concerns tackled end-to-end.

- [dinogaia](projects/dinogaia/)
- [realpolymarket](projects/realpolymarket/)

## Apps

> Lightweight apps and landing pages that stay minimal by design.

- [utilityaf](websites/utilityaf/)
- [betterlido](websites/betterlido/)
- [0xbuidlerhq](websites/0xbuidlerhq/)

## Packages

> Reusable building blocks shared across the stack, even when they are not published as standalone packages.
