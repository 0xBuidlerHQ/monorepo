What a weird feeling to turn 29.
Those last few months I really started to think more. Good thing you'd say. Well, yes and no. Yes because of course it's such a blessing to be able to think and analyze. But it can become a nightmare when it becomes overthinking, or worse ... analysis paralysis.

This last year a few things happened in my personal life, my grand father died - joining my grand mother who died in 2021, my last working experience was a shit show and I got let go from speaking up (maybe I'll talk about this one day) and had a weird but also very sad break up. Very personal right, lol. If it feels uncomfortable for you to read this, imagine how I feel writing this and sharing it online for the whole world (actually just 2 people - me and the google web scrapper bot) to see.

After the end of my job - *effective immediately* - and the end of my relationship - *effective immediately too lol* - I felt lonely.
Most of my friends don't live in my city anymore and the ones who do are too busy with their own life. And I guess it's just harder now than what it used to be when we only had to think about homeworks and Pokemon cards.

As a result of all those events and feelings, the last few months were filled with a lot of thoughts. Those thoughts were all mixed with anxiety & analysis paralysis.
Is this the right choice ? Should I take this job ? Should I move there ? Should I start a youtube channel ? If so about what ? Should I do this ? Should I do that ?

One thing I know for sure is that I wouldn't have all those thoughts if I were to be in a really tough spot. The reason why I'm having those is because I'm in a place of comfort, which allows me to stop and think - too much.

One thing I realized as well, is that we really all are going through some kind of things like that but we generally don't really like talking about it. Which makes sense. It feels weird exposing yourself. But truth being said who cares anyway. It's not like people will remember us in a hundreds or thousands years.

This is going a little bit all over the place for a first though but to be honest it's just like me.

Today's quote will be from *Marcus Aurelius* in his book *Meditations* :

> It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.
